## Features

- Responsive design
- TypeScript support
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Vite for fast development
- Django Rest Framework for the API

## Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It is powered by the [Vite](https://vitejs.com/) build tool.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is a React-based application that provides a user interface for managing the ecommerce platform. It is also built with TypeScript and TailwindCSS, and uses Vite as the build tool.

## API

The API is built with Django Rest Framework and provides a RESTful interface for the frontend and dashboard to interact with the ecommerce platform's data.

## File Structure

Each project has a similar file structure, with a few differences depending on the specifics of the project.

### Frontend

The frontend project has the following file structure:

```markdown
frontend/
├── src/
│ ├── components/ # directory containing reusable UI components
│ ├── pages/      # directory containing top-level pages
│ ├── services/   # directory containing utility functions and API clients
│ ├── App.ts      # root component of the application
│ ├── index.tsx   # entry point for the application
│ ├── router.tsx  # routing configuration for the application
│ └── types.ts    # shared type definitions for
```

### Dashboard

The dashboard project has the following file structure:

```markdown
dashboard/
├── src/
│ ├── components/    # directory containing reusable UI components
│ ├── pages/         # directory containing top-level pages
│ ├── services/      # directory containing utility functions and API clients
│ ├── App.tsx        # root component of the application
│ ├── index.tsx      # entry point for the application
│ ├── router.tsx     # routing configuration for the application
│ └── types.ts       # shared type definitions for the application
├── public/          # directory containing static assets (e.g. images)
├── .vite.config.js  # configuration file for the Vite build tool
└── package.json     # metadata for the project and its dependencies
```

### API

The API project has the following file structure:

```markdown
api/
│ ├── migrations/     # directory containing database migration files
│ ├── static/         # directory containing static assets (e.g. images)
│ ├── templates/      # directory containing HTML templates
│ ├── apps/           # directory containing Django apps
│ ├── config/         # directory containing project-level configuration
│ ├── manage.py       # command-line utility for interacting with the Django project
│ ├── urls.py         # URL configuration for the Django project
│ └── wsgi.py         # WSGI configuration for the Django project
└── requirements.txt  # file containing project dependencies
```

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies for each project by running `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of the project.
2. Follow the [Starting the Projects](#starting-the-projects) instructions to start each project.
3. Explore the application and make any desired modifications.```

## Starting the Projects

To start the projects in this repository, you will need to have Node.js and Python installed on your machine. You will also need to install the dependencies for each project by running `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of the project.

### Frontend

To start the frontend project, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command:

```markdown
> cd frontend
> npm run dev
```

This will start the development server for the frontend project, and you can view the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Dashboard

To start the dashboard project, navigate to the `dashboard` directory and run the following command:

```markdown
> cd dashboard
> npm run dev
```

This will start the development server for the dashboard project, and you can view the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### API

To start the API project, navigate to the `api` directory and run the following command:

```markdown
> cd api
> python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the development server for the API project, and you can view the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Documentation

The frontend and dashboard projects include documentation generated by the [TSDocs](https://tsdocs.org/) tool. You can find the documentation in the `docs` directories of those projects.

The API's documentation can be found in ....

- Documentation for the frontend project: [frontend/docs](frontend/docs)
- Documentation for the dashboard project: [dashboard/docs](dashboard/docs)
- Documentation for the api project: [api/...](api/...)

## Sending Requests to the API

The API in this ecommerce platform is built with Django Rest Framework and provides a RESTful interface for the frontend and dashboard to interact with the ecommerce platform's data. You can send requests to the API using any HTTP client, such as cURL or a browser extension like Postman.

To send a request to the API, you will need to specify the following information:

- The HTTP method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- The endpoint (e.g. `/api/products`, `/api/orders`)
- Any necessary request parameters or body data
- An `Authorization` header with a valid JWT token, if the endpoint requires authentication

Here is an example of a `GET` request to retrieve a list of products from the API using cURL:

```markdown
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/products -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>'
```

This will send a `GET` request to the `/api/products` endpoint, with an `Authorization` header containing a JWT token for authentication. The API will return a list of products in the response.

You can find more information on the available endpoints and request parameters in the [API's documentation](#documentation).
